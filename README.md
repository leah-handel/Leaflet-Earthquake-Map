## General Info

This project maps earthquakes recorded by the USGS in the past 7 days, along with tectonic plate boundaries. Use the map controls in the top right corner to switch between street and topographical basemaps, and to add or remove earthquake and plate layers.

Done for week 17 homework for the Northwestern Data Science and Visualization Bootcamp.
